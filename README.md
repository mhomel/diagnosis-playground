# Diagnosis Playground ðŸ§¬  
This is a small data project I created to practice analyzing structured health-related data using Python.

The dataset contains fictional patient records, including:  
- height and weight  
- blood pressure and heart rate  
- cholesterol levels  
- overall health status (e.g. "healthy", "heart condition")

I treated it like a simplified diagnostic lab to explore:  
- condition-based classification functions    
- group-level analysis (by gender and health status)  
- basic visualizations using matplotlib and pandas

---

### Tools used  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- NumPy  

---

### What I learned from it ðŸ’¡  
- How to write condition-based logic to classify risk  
- How to group and compare patient subsets  
- How to visualize health patterns across categories  

---
 
**The dataset is entirely fictional and randomly generated â€” no real patient data was used.**  
I made this to think through how structured data can be used for reasoning, not just number crunching.  
Itâ€™s simple, but it helped me build confidence and organize logic in a clearer way.

ðŸ“¬ Feedback is welcome - I'm still learning and improving every day!
